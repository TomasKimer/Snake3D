<h2><a name="chapter-9">Chapter 9: Mixing 16 and 32 Bit Code</a></h2>
<p>This chapter tries to cover some of the issues, largely related to
unusual forms of addressing and jump instructions, encountered when writing
operating system code such as protected-mode initialisation routines, which
require code that operates in mixed segment sizes, such as code in a 16-bit
segment trying to modify data in a 32-bit one, or jumps between
different-size segments.
<h3><a name="section-9.1">9.1 Mixed-Size Jumps</a></h3>
<p>The most common form of mixed-size instruction is the one used when
writing a 32-bit OS: having done your setup in 16-bit mode, such as loading
the kernel, you then have to boot it by switching into protected mode and
jumping to the 32-bit kernel start address. In a fully 32-bit OS, this
tends to be the <em>only</em> mixed-size instruction you need, since
everything before it can be done in pure 16-bit code, and everything after
it can be pure 32-bit.
<p>This jump must specify a 48-bit far address, since the target segment is
a 32-bit one. However, it must be assembled in a 16-bit segment, so just
coding, for example,
<p><pre>
        jmp     0x1234:0x56789ABC       ; wrong!
</pre>
<p>will not work, since the offset part of the address will be truncated to
<code><nobr>0x9ABC</nobr></code> and the jump will be an ordinary 16-bit
far one.
<p>The Linux kernel setup code gets round the inability of
<code><nobr>as86</nobr></code> to generate the required instruction by
coding it manually, using <code><nobr>DB</nobr></code> instructions. NASM
can go one better than that, by actually generating the right instruction
itself. Here's how to do it right:
<p><pre>
        jmp     dword 0x1234:0x56789ABC         ; right
</pre>
<p>The <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> prefix (strictly speaking, it should
come <em>after</em> the colon, since it is declaring the <em>offset</em>
field to be a doubleword; but NASM will accept either form, since both are
unambiguous) forces the offset part to be treated as far, in the assumption
that you are deliberately writing a jump from a 16-bit segment to a 32-bit
one.
<p>You can do the reverse operation, jumping from a 32-bit segment to a
16-bit one, by means of the <code><nobr>WORD</nobr></code> prefix:
<p><pre>
        jmp     word 0x8765:0x4321      ; 32 to 16 bit
</pre>
<p>If the <code><nobr>WORD</nobr></code> prefix is specified in 16-bit
mode, or the <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> prefix in 32-bit mode, they
will be ignored, since each is explicitly forcing NASM into a mode it was
in anyway.
<h3><a name="section-9.2">9.2 Addressing Between Different-Size Segments</a></h3>
<p>If your OS is mixed 16 and 32-bit, or if you are writing a DOS extender,
you are likely to have to deal with some 16-bit segments and some 32-bit
ones. At some point, you will probably end up writing code in a 16-bit
segment which has to access data in a 32-bit segment, or vice versa.
<p>If the data you are trying to access in a 32-bit segment lies within the
first 64K of the segment, you may be able to get away with using an
ordinary 16-bit addressing operation for the purpose; but sooner or later,
you will want to do 32-bit addressing from 16-bit mode.
<p>The easiest way to do this is to make sure you use a register for the
address, since any effective address containing a 32-bit register is forced
to be a 32-bit address. So you can do
<p><pre>
        mov     eax,offset_into_32_bit_segment_specified_by_fs 
        mov     dword [fs:eax],0x11223344
</pre>
<p>This is fine, but slightly cumbersome (since it wastes an instruction
and a register) if you already know the precise offset you are aiming at.
The x86 architecture does allow 32-bit effective addresses to specify
nothing but a 4-byte offset, so why shouldn't NASM be able to generate the
best instruction for the purpose?
<p>It can. As in <a href="#section-9.1">section 9.1</a>, you need only
prefix the address with the <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> keyword, and it
will be forced to be a 32-bit address:
<p><pre>
        mov     dword [fs:dword my_offset],0x11223344
</pre>
<p>Also as in <a href="#section-9.1">section 9.1</a>, NASM is not fussy
about whether the <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> prefix comes before or
after the segment override, so arguably a nicer-looking way to code the
above instruction is
<p><pre>
        mov     dword [dword fs:my_offset],0x11223344
</pre>
<p>Don't confuse the <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> prefix
<em>outside</em> the square brackets, which controls the size of the data
stored at the address, with the one <code><nobr>inside</nobr></code> the
square brackets which controls the length of the address itself. The two
can quite easily be different:
<p><pre>
        mov     word [dword 0x12345678],0x9ABC
</pre>
<p>This moves 16 bits of data to an address specified by a 32-bit offset.
<p>You can also specify <code><nobr>WORD</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> prefixes along with the
<code><nobr>FAR</nobr></code> prefix to indirect far jumps or calls. For
example:
<p><pre>
        call    dword far [fs:word 0x4321]
</pre>
<p>This instruction contains an address specified by a 16-bit offset; it
loads a 48-bit far pointer from that (16-bit segment and 32-bit offset),
and calls that address.
<h3><a name="section-9.3">9.3 Other Mixed-Size Instructions</a></h3>
<p>The other way you might want to access data might be using the string
instructions (<code><nobr>LODSx</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>STOSx</nobr></code> and so on) or the
<code><nobr>XLATB</nobr></code> instruction. These instructions, since they
take no parameters, might seem to have no easy way to make them perform
32-bit addressing when assembled in a 16-bit segment.
<p>This is the purpose of NASM's <code><nobr>a16</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>a32</nobr></code> prefixes. If you are coding
<code><nobr>LODSB</nobr></code> in a 16-bit segment but it is supposed to
be accessing a string in a 32-bit segment, you should load the desired
address into <code><nobr>ESI</nobr></code> and then code
<p><pre>
        a32     lodsb
</pre>
<p>The prefix forces the addressing size to 32 bits, meaning that
<code><nobr>LODSB</nobr></code> loads from
<code><nobr>[DS:ESI]</nobr></code> instead of
<code><nobr>[DS:SI]</nobr></code>. To access a string in a 16-bit segment
when coding in a 32-bit one, the corresponding
<code><nobr>a16</nobr></code> prefix can be used.
<p>The <code><nobr>a16</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>a32</nobr></code>
prefixes can be applied to any instruction in NASM's instruction table, but
most of them can generate all the useful forms without them. The prefixes
are necessary only for instructions with implicit addressing:
<code><nobr>CMPSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.27">section B.4.27</a>),
<code><nobr>SCASx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.286">section B.4.286</a>),
<code><nobr>LODSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.141">section B.4.141</a>),
<code><nobr>STOSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.303">section B.4.303</a>),
<code><nobr>MOVSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.178">section B.4.178</a>),
<code><nobr>INSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.121">section B.4.121</a>),
<code><nobr>OUTSx</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.195">section B.4.195</a>), and
<code><nobr>XLATB</nobr></code>
(<a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.334">section B.4.334</a>). Also, the
various push and pop instructions (<code><nobr>PUSHA</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>POPF</nobr></code> as well as the more usual
<code><nobr>PUSH</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>POP</nobr></code>) can
accept <code><nobr>a16</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>a32</nobr></code>
prefixes to force a particular one of <code><nobr>SP</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>ESP</nobr></code> to be used as a stack pointer, in case the
stack segment in use is a different size from the code segment.
<p><code><nobr>PUSH</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>POP</nobr></code>, when
applied to segment registers in 32-bit mode, also have the slightly odd
behaviour that they push and pop 4 bytes at a time, of which the top two
are ignored and the bottom two give the value of the segment register being
manipulated. To force the 16-bit behaviour of segment-register push and pop
instructions, you can use the operand-size prefix
<code><nobr>o16</nobr></code>:
<p><pre>
        o16 push    ss 
        o16 push    ds
</pre>
<p>This code saves a doubleword of stack space by fitting two segment
registers into the space which would normally be consumed by pushing one.
<p>(You can also use the <code><nobr>o32</nobr></code> prefix to force the
32-bit behaviour when in 16-bit mode, but this seems less useful.)
