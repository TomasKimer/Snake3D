<h2><a name="chapter-1">Chapter 1: Introduction</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section-1.1">1.1 What Is NASM?</a></h3>
<p>The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 assembler designed for
portability and modularity. It supports a range of object file formats,
including Linux and <code><nobr>NetBSD/FreeBSD</nobr></code>
<code><nobr>a.out</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>ELF</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>COFF</nobr></code>, Microsoft 16-bit
<code><nobr>OBJ</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>Win32</nobr></code>. It will
also output plain binary files. Its syntax is designed to be simple and
easy to understand, similar to Intel's but less complex. It supports
<code><nobr>Pentium</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>P6</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>MMX</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>3DNow!</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>SSE</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>SSE2</nobr></code> opcodes,
and has macro capability.
<h4><a name="section-1.1.1">1.1.1 Why Yet Another Assembler?</a></h4>
<p>The Netwide Assembler grew out of an idea on
<code><nobr>comp.lang.asm.x86</nobr></code> (or possibly
<code><nobr>alt.lang.asm</nobr></code> - I forget which), which was
essentially that there didn't seem to be a good <em>free</em> x86-series
assembler around, and that maybe someone ought to write one.
<ul>
<li><code><nobr>a86</nobr></code> is good, but not free, and in particular
you don't get any 32-bit capability until you pay. It's DOS only, too.
<li><code><nobr>gas</nobr></code> is free, and ports over DOS and Unix, but
it's not very good, since it's designed to be a back end to
<code><nobr>gcc</nobr></code>, which always feeds it correct code. So its
error checking is minimal. Also, its syntax is horrible, from the point of
view of anyone trying to actually <em>write</em> anything in it. Plus you
can't write 16-bit code in it (properly).
<li><code><nobr>as86</nobr></code> is Minix- and Linux-specific, and (my
version at least) doesn't seem to have much (or any) documentation.
<li><code><nobr>MASM</nobr></code> isn't very good, and it's (was)
expensive, and it runs only under DOS.
<li><code><nobr>TASM</nobr></code> is better, but still strives for MASM
compatibility, which means millions of directives and tons of red tape. And
its syntax is essentially MASM's, with the contradictions and quirks that
entails (although it sorts out some of those by means of Ideal mode). It's
expensive too. And it's DOS-only.
</ul>
<p>So here, for your coding pleasure, is NASM. At present it's still in
prototype stage - we don't promise that it can outperform any of these
assemblers. But please, <em>please</em> send us bug reports, fixes, helpful
information, and anything else you can get your hands on (and thanks to the
many people who've done this already! You all know who you are), and we'll
improve it out of all recognition. Again.

<h3><a name="section-1.3">1.3 Installation</a></h3>
<h4><a name="section-1.3.1">1.3.1 Installing NASM under MS-DOS or Windows</a></h4>
<p>Once you've obtained the DOS archive for NASM,
<code><nobr>nasmXXX.zip</nobr></code> (where <code><nobr>XXX</nobr></code>
denotes the version number of NASM contained in the archive), unpack it
into its own directory (for example <code><nobr>c:\nasm</nobr></code>).
<p>The archive will contain four executable files: the NASM executable
files <code><nobr>nasm.exe</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>nasmw.exe</nobr></code>, and the NDISASM executable files
<code><nobr>ndisasm.exe</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>ndisasmw.exe</nobr></code>. In each case, the file whose name
ends in <code><nobr>w</nobr></code> is a <code><nobr>Win32</nobr></code>
executable, designed to run under <code><nobr>Windows 95</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>Windows NT</nobr></code> Intel, and the other one is a 16-bit
<code><nobr>DOS</nobr></code> executable.
<p>The only file NASM needs to run is its own executable, so copy (at
least) one of <code><nobr>nasm.exe</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>nasmw.exe</nobr></code> to a directory on your PATH, or
alternatively edit <code><nobr>autoexec.bat</nobr></code> to add the
<code><nobr>nasm</nobr></code> directory to your
<code><nobr>PATH</nobr></code>. (If you're only installing the
<code><nobr>Win32</nobr></code> version, you may wish to rename it to
<code><nobr>nasm.exe</nobr></code>.)
<p>That's it - NASM is installed. You don't need the nasm directory to be
present to run NASM (unless you've added it to your
<code><nobr>PATH</nobr></code>), so you can delete it if you need to save
space; however, you may want to keep the documentation or test programs.
<p>If you've downloaded the DOS source archive,
<code><nobr>nasmXXXs.zip</nobr></code>, the <code><nobr>nasm</nobr></code>
directory will also contain the full NASM source code, and a selection of
Makefiles you can (hopefully) use to rebuild your copy of NASM from
scratch.
<p>Note that the source files <code><nobr>insnsa.c</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>insnsd.c</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>insnsi.h</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>insnsn.c</nobr></code> are automatically generated from the
master instruction table <code><nobr>insns.dat</nobr></code> by a Perl
script; the file <code><nobr>macros.c</nobr></code> is generated from
<code><nobr>standard.mac</nobr></code> by another Perl script. Although the
NASM source distribution includes these generated files, you will need to
rebuild them (and hence, will need a Perl interpreter) if you change
insns.dat, standard.mac or the documentation. It is possible future source
distributions may not include these files at all. Ports of Perl for a
variety of platforms, including DOS and Windows, are available from
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/ports/">www.cpan.org</a>.
<h4><a name="section-1.3.2">1.3.2 Installing NASM under Unix</a></h4>
<p>Once you've obtained the Unix source archive for NASM,
<code><nobr>nasm-X.XX.tar.gz</nobr></code> (where
<code><nobr>X.XX</nobr></code> denotes the version number of NASM contained
in the archive), unpack it into a directory such as
<code><nobr>/usr/local/src</nobr></code>. The archive, when unpacked, will
create its own subdirectory <code><nobr>nasm-X.XX</nobr></code>.
<p>NASM is an auto-configuring package: once you've unpacked it,
<code><nobr>cd</nobr></code> to the directory it's been unpacked into and
type <code><nobr>./configure</nobr></code>. This shell script will find the
best C compiler to use for building NASM and set up Makefiles accordingly.
<p>Once NASM has auto-configured, you can type
<code><nobr>make</nobr></code> to build the <code><nobr>nasm</nobr></code>
and <code><nobr>ndisasm</nobr></code> binaries, and then
<code><nobr>make install</nobr></code> to install them in
<code><nobr>/usr/local/bin</nobr></code> and install the man pages
<code><nobr>nasm.1</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>ndisasm.1</nobr></code> in
<code><nobr>/usr/local/man/man1</nobr></code>. Alternatively, you can give
options such as <code><nobr>--prefix</nobr></code> to the configure script
(see the file <code><nobr>INSTALL</nobr></code> for more details), or
install the programs yourself.
<p>NASM also comes with a set of utilities for handling the
<code><nobr>RDOFF</nobr></code> custom object-file format, which are in the
<code><nobr>rdoff</nobr></code> subdirectory of the NASM archive. You can
build these with <code><nobr>make rdf</nobr></code> and install them with
<code><nobr>make rdf_install</nobr></code>, if you want them.
<p>If NASM fails to auto-configure, you may still be able to make it
compile by using the fall-back Unix makefile
<code><nobr>Makefile.unx</nobr></code>. Copy or rename that file to
<code><nobr>Makefile</nobr></code> and try typing
<code><nobr>make</nobr></code>. There is also a Makefile.unx file in the
<code><nobr>rdoff</nobr></code> subdirectory.
