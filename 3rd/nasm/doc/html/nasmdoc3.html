<h2><a name="chapter-3">Chapter 3: The NASM Language</a></h2>
<h3><a name="section-3.1">3.1 Layout of a NASM Source Line</a></h3>
<p>Like most assemblers, each NASM source line contains (unless it is a
macro, a preprocessor directive or an assembler directive: see
<a href="nasmdoc4.html">chapter 4</a> and <a href="nasmdoc5.html">chapter
5</a>) some combination of the four fields
<p><pre>
label:    instruction operands        ; comment
</pre>
<p>As usual, most of these fields are optional; the presence or absence of
any combination of a label, an instruction and a comment is allowed. Of
course, the operand field is either required or forbidden by the presence
and nature of the instruction field.
<p>NASM uses backslash (\) as the line continuation character; if a line
ends with backslash, the next line is considered to be a part of the
backslash-ended line.
<p>NASM places no restrictions on white space within a line: labels may
have white space before them, or instructions may have no space before
them, or anything. The colon after a label is also optional. (Note that
this means that if you intend to code <code><nobr>lodsb</nobr></code> alone
on a line, and type <code><nobr>lodab</nobr></code> by accident, then
that's still a valid source line which does nothing but define a label.
Running NASM with the command-line option
<code><nobr>-w+orphan-labels</nobr></code> will cause it to warn you if you
define a label alone on a line without a trailing colon.)
<p>Valid characters in labels are letters, numbers,
<code><nobr>_</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>$</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>#</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>@</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>~</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>.</nobr></code>, and
<code><nobr>?</nobr></code>. The only characters which may be used as the
<em>first</em> character of an identifier are letters,
<code><nobr>.</nobr></code> (with special meaning: see
<a href="#section-3.9">section 3.9</a>), <code><nobr>_</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>?</nobr></code>. An identifier may also be prefixed with a
<code><nobr>$</nobr></code> to indicate that it is intended to be read as
an identifier and not a reserved word; thus, if some other module you are
linking with defines a symbol called <code><nobr>eax</nobr></code>, you can
refer to <code><nobr>$eax</nobr></code> in NASM code to distinguish the
symbol from the register. Maximum length of an identifier is 4095
characters.
<p>The instruction field may contain any machine instruction: Pentium and
P6 instructions, FPU instructions, MMX instructions and even undocumented
instructions are all supported. The instruction may be prefixed by
<code><nobr>LOCK</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>REP</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>REPE</nobr></code>/<code><nobr>REPZ</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>REPNE</nobr></code>/<code><nobr>REPNZ</nobr></code>, in the
usual way. Explicit address-size and operand-size prefixes
<code><nobr>A16</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>A32</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>O16</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>O32</nobr></code> are
provided - one example of their use is given in
<a href="nasmdoc9.html">chapter 9</a>. You can also use the name of a
segment register as an instruction prefix: coding
<code><nobr>es mov [bx],ax</nobr></code> is equivalent to coding
<code><nobr>mov [es:bx],ax</nobr></code>. We recommend the latter syntax,
since it is consistent with other syntactic features of the language, but
for instructions such as <code><nobr>LODSB</nobr></code>, which has no
operands and yet can require a segment override, there is no clean
syntactic way to proceed apart from <code><nobr>es lodsb</nobr></code>.
<p>An instruction is not required to use a prefix: prefixes such as
<code><nobr>CS</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>A32</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>LOCK</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>REPE</nobr></code> can appear
on a line by themselves, and NASM will just generate the prefix bytes.
<p>In addition to actual machine instructions, NASM also supports a number
of pseudo-instructions, described in <a href="#section-3.2">section
3.2</a>.
<p>Instruction operands may take a number of forms: they can be registers,
described simply by the register name (e.g. <code><nobr>ax</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>bp</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>ebx</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>cr0</nobr></code>: NASM does not use the
<code><nobr>gas</nobr></code>-style syntax in which register names must be
prefixed by a <code><nobr>%</nobr></code> sign), or they can be effective
addresses (see <a href="#section-3.3">section 3.3</a>), constants
(<a href="#section-3.4">section 3.4</a>) or expressions
(<a href="#section-3.5">section 3.5</a>).
<p>For floating-point instructions, NASM accepts a wide range of syntaxes:
you can use two-operand forms like MASM supports, or you can use NASM's
native single-operand forms in most cases. Details of all forms of each
supported instruction are given in <a href="nasmdocb.html">appendix B</a>.
For example, you can code:
<p><pre>
        fadd    st1             ; this sets st0 := st0 + st1 
        fadd    st0,st1         ; so does this 

        fadd    st1,st0         ; this sets st1 := st1 + st0 
        fadd    to st1          ; so does this
</pre>
<p>Almost any floating-point instruction that references memory must use
one of the prefixes <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>QWORD</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>TWORD</nobr></code> to
indicate what size of memory operand it refers to.
<h3><a name="section-3.2">3.2 Pseudo-Instructions</a></h3>
<p>Pseudo-instructions are things which, though not real x86 machine
instructions, are used in the instruction field anyway because that's the
most convenient place to put them. The current pseudo-instructions are
<code><nobr>DB</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DW</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>DD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DQ</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>DT</nobr></code>, their uninitialised counterparts
<code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>RESW</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>RESD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>RESQ</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>REST</nobr></code>, the <code><nobr>INCBIN</nobr></code>
command, the <code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> command, and the
<code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> prefix.
<h4><a name="section-3.2.1">3.2.1 <code><nobr>DB</nobr></code> and friends: Declaring Initialised Data</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>DB</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DW</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>DD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DQ</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>DT</nobr></code> are used, much as in MASM, to declare
initialised data in the output file. They can be invoked in a wide range of
ways:
<p><pre>
      db    0x55                ; just the byte 0x55 
      db    0x55,0x56,0x57      ; three bytes in succession 
      db    'a',0x55            ; character constants are OK 
      db    'hello',13,10,'$'   ; so are string constants 
      dw    0x1234              ; 0x34 0x12 
      dw    'a'                 ; 0x61 0x00 (it's just a number) 
      dw    'ab'                ; 0x61 0x62 (character constant) 
      dw    'abc'               ; 0x61 0x62 0x63 0x00 (string) 
      dd    0x12345678          ; 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 
      dd    1.234567e20         ; floating-point constant 
      dq    1.234567e20         ; double-precision float 
      dt    1.234567e20         ; extended-precision float
</pre>
<p><code><nobr>DQ</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>DT</nobr></code> do not
accept numeric constants or string constants as operands.
<h4><a name="section-3.2.2">3.2.2 <code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code> and friends: Declaring Uninitialised Data</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>RESW</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>RESD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>RESQ</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>REST</nobr></code> are designed to be used in the BSS section
of a module: they declare <em>uninitialised</em> storage space. Each takes
a single operand, which is the number of bytes, words, doublewords or
whatever to reserve. As stated in
<a href="nasmdoc2.html#section-2.2.7">section 2.2.7</a>, NASM does not
support the MASM/TASM syntax of reserving uninitialised space by writing
<code><nobr>DW ?</nobr></code> or similar things: this is what it does
instead. The operand to a <code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code>-type
pseudo-instruction is a <em>critical expression</em>: see
<a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a>.
<p>For example:
<p><pre>
buffer:         resb    64              ; reserve 64 bytes 
wordvar:        resw    1               ; reserve a word 
realarray       resq    10              ; array of ten reals
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-3.2.3">3.2.3 <code><nobr>INCBIN</nobr></code>: Including External Binary Files</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>INCBIN</nobr></code> is borrowed from the old Amiga
assembler DevPac: it includes a binary file verbatim into the output file.
This can be handy for (for example) including graphics and sound data
directly into a game executable file. It can be called in one of these
three ways:
<p><pre>
    incbin  "file.dat"             ; include the whole file 
    incbin  "file.dat",1024        ; skip the first 1024 bytes 
    incbin  "file.dat",1024,512    ; skip the first 1024, and 
                                   ; actually include at most 512
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-3.2.4">3.2.4 <code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code>: Defining Constants</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> defines a symbol to a given constant
value: when <code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> is used, the source line must
contain a label. The action of <code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> is to define
the given label name to the value of its (only) operand. This definition is
absolute, and cannot change later. So, for example,
<p><pre>
message         db      'hello, world' 
msglen          equ     $-message
</pre>
<p>defines <code><nobr>msglen</nobr></code> to be the constant 12.
<code><nobr>msglen</nobr></code> may not then be redefined later. This is
not a preprocessor definition either: the value of
<code><nobr>msglen</nobr></code> is evaluated <em>once</em>, using the
value of <code><nobr>$</nobr></code> (see <a href="#section-3.5">section
3.5</a> for an explanation of <code><nobr>$</nobr></code>) at the point of
definition, rather than being evaluated wherever it is referenced and using
the value of <code><nobr>$</nobr></code> at the point of reference. Note
that the operand to an <code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> is also a critical
expression (<a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a>).
<h4><a name="section-3.2.5">3.2.5 <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code>: Repeating Instructions or Data</a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> prefix causes the instruction to be
assembled multiple times. This is partly present as NASM's equivalent of
the <code><nobr>DUP</nobr></code> syntax supported by MASM-compatible
assemblers, in that you can code
<p><pre>
zerobuf:        times 64 db 0
</pre>
<p>or similar things; but <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> is more versatile
than that. The argument to <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> is not just a
numeric constant, but a numeric <em>expression</em>, so you can do things
like
<p><pre>
buffer: db      'hello, world' 
        times 64-$+buffer db ' '
</pre>
<p>which will store exactly enough spaces to make the total length of
<code><nobr>buffer</nobr></code> up to 64. Finally,
<code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> can be applied to ordinary instructions, so
you can code trivial unrolled loops in it:
<p><pre>
        times 100 movsb
</pre>
<p>Note that there is no effective difference between
<code><nobr>times 100 resb 1</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>resb 100</nobr></code>, except that the latter will be
assembled about 100 times faster due to the internal structure of the
assembler.
<p>The operand to <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code>, like that of
<code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> and those of <code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code>
and friends, is a critical expression (<a href="#section-3.8">section
3.8</a>).
<p>Note also that <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> can't be applied to
macros: the reason for this is that <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> is
processed after the macro phase, which allows the argument to
<code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> to contain expressions such as
<code><nobr>64-$+buffer</nobr></code> as above. To repeat more than one
line of code, or a complex macro, use the preprocessor
<code><nobr>%rep</nobr></code> directive.
<h3><a name="section-3.3">3.3 Effective Addresses</a></h3>
<p>An effective address is any operand to an instruction which references
memory. Effective addresses, in NASM, have a very simple syntax: they
consist of an expression evaluating to the desired address, enclosed in
square brackets. For example:
<p><pre>
wordvar dw      123 
        mov     ax,[wordvar] 
        mov     ax,[wordvar+1] 
        mov     ax,[es:wordvar+bx]
</pre>
<p>Anything not conforming to this simple system is not a valid memory
reference in NASM, for example <code><nobr>es:wordvar[bx]</nobr></code>.
<p>More complicated effective addresses, such as those involving more than
one register, work in exactly the same way:
<p><pre>
        mov     eax,[ebx*2+ecx+offset] 
        mov     ax,[bp+di+8]
</pre>
<p>NASM is capable of doing algebra on these effective addresses, so that
things which don't necessarily <em>look</em> legal are perfectly all right:
<p><pre>
    mov     eax,[ebx*5]             ; assembles as [ebx*4+ebx] 
    mov     eax,[label1*2-label2]   ; ie [label1+(label1-label2)]
</pre>
<p>Some forms of effective address have more than one assembled form; in
most such cases NASM will generate the smallest form it can. For example,
there are distinct assembled forms for the 32-bit effective addresses
<code><nobr>[eax*2+0]</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>[eax+eax]</nobr></code>, and NASM will generally generate the
latter on the grounds that the former requires four bytes to store a zero
offset.
<p>NASM has a hinting mechanism which will cause
<code><nobr>[eax+ebx]</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>[ebx+eax]</nobr></code>
to generate different opcodes; this is occasionally useful because
<code><nobr>[esi+ebp]</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>[ebp+esi]</nobr></code>
have different default segment registers.
<p>However, you can force NASM to generate an effective address in a
particular form by the use of the keywords <code><nobr>BYTE</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>WORD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>NOSPLIT</nobr></code>. If you need
<code><nobr>[eax+3]</nobr></code> to be assembled using a double-word
offset field instead of the one byte NASM will normally generate, you can
code <code><nobr>[dword eax+3]</nobr></code>. Similarly, you can force NASM
to use a byte offset for a small value which it hasn't seen on the first
pass (see <a href="#section-3.8">section 3.8</a> for an example of such a
code fragment) by using <code><nobr>[byte eax+offset]</nobr></code>. As
special cases, <code><nobr>[byte eax]</nobr></code> will code
<code><nobr>[eax+0]</nobr></code> with a byte offset of zero, and
<code><nobr>[dword eax]</nobr></code> will code it with a double-word
offset of zero. The normal form, <code><nobr>[eax]</nobr></code>, will be
coded with no offset field.
<p>The form described in the previous paragraph is also useful if you are
trying to access data in a 32-bit segment from within 16 bit code. For more
information on this see the section on mixed-size addressing
(<a href="nasmdoc9.html#section-9.2">section 9.2</a>). In particular, if
you need to access data with a known offset that is larger than will fit in
a 16-bit value, if you don't specify that it is a dword offset, nasm will
cause the high word of the offset to be lost.
<p>Similarly, NASM will split <code><nobr>[eax*2]</nobr></code> into
<code><nobr>[eax+eax]</nobr></code> because that allows the offset field to
be absent and space to be saved; in fact, it will also split
<code><nobr>[eax*2+offset]</nobr></code> into
<code><nobr>[eax+eax+offset]</nobr></code>. You can combat this behaviour
by the use of the <code><nobr>NOSPLIT</nobr></code> keyword:
<code><nobr>[nosplit eax*2]</nobr></code> will force
<code><nobr>[eax*2+0]</nobr></code> to be generated literally.
<h3><a name="section-3.4">3.4 Constants</a></h3>
<p>NASM understands four different types of constant: numeric, character,
string and floating-point.
<h4><a name="section-3.4.1">3.4.1 Numeric Constants</a></h4>
<p>A numeric constant is simply a number. NASM allows you to specify
numbers in a variety of number bases, in a variety of ways: you can suffix
<code><nobr>H</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>Q</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>O</nobr></code>, and <code><nobr>B</nobr></code> for hex, octal
and binary, or you can prefix <code><nobr>0x</nobr></code> for hex in the
style of C, or you can prefix <code><nobr>$</nobr></code> for hex in the
style of Borland Pascal. Note, though, that the <code><nobr>$</nobr></code>
prefix does double duty as a prefix on identifiers (see
<a href="#section-3.1">section 3.1</a>), so a hex number prefixed with a
<code><nobr>$</nobr></code> sign must have a digit after the
<code><nobr>$</nobr></code> rather than a letter.
<p>Some examples:
<p><pre>
        mov     ax,100          ; decimal 
        mov     ax,0a2h         ; hex 
        mov     ax,$0a2         ; hex again: the 0 is required 
        mov     ax,0xa2         ; hex yet again 
        mov     ax,777q         ; octal 
        mov     ax,777o         ; octal again 
        mov     ax,10010011b    ; binary
</pre>
<h4><a name="section-3.4.2">3.4.2 Character Constants</a></h4>
<p>A character constant consists of up to four characters enclosed in
either single or double quotes. The type of quote makes no difference to
NASM, except of course that surrounding the constant with single quotes
allows double quotes to appear within it and vice versa.
<p>A character constant with more than one character will be arranged with
little-endian order in mind: if you code
<p><pre>
          mov eax,'abcd'
</pre>
<p>then the constant generated is not <code><nobr>0x61626364</nobr></code>,
but <code><nobr>0x64636261</nobr></code>, so that if you were then to store
the value into memory, it would read <code><nobr>abcd</nobr></code> rather
than <code><nobr>dcba</nobr></code>. This is also the sense of character
constants understood by the Pentium's <code><nobr>CPUID</nobr></code>
instruction (see <a href="nasmdocb.html#section-B.4.34">section
B.4.34</a>).
<h4><a name="section-3.4.3">3.4.3 String Constants</a></h4>
<p>String constants are only acceptable to some pseudo-instructions, namely
the <code><nobr>DB</nobr></code> family and
<code><nobr>INCBIN</nobr></code>.
<p>A string constant looks like a character constant, only longer. It is
treated as a concatenation of maximum-size character constants for the
conditions. So the following are equivalent:
<p><pre>
      db    'hello'               ; string constant 
      db    'h','e','l','l','o'   ; equivalent character constants
</pre>
<p>And the following are also equivalent:
<p><pre>
      dd    'ninechars'           ; doubleword string constant 
      dd    'nine','char','s'     ; becomes three doublewords 
      db    'ninechars',0,0,0     ; and really looks like this
</pre>
<p>Note that when used as an operand to <code><nobr>db</nobr></code>, a
constant like <code><nobr>'ab'</nobr></code> is treated as a string
constant despite being short enough to be a character constant, because
otherwise <code><nobr>db 'ab'</nobr></code> would have the same effect as
<code><nobr>db 'a'</nobr></code>, which would be silly. Similarly,
three-character or four-character constants are treated as strings when
they are operands to <code><nobr>dw</nobr></code>.
<h4><a name="section-3.4.4">3.4.4 Floating-Point Constants</a></h4>
<p>Floating-point constants are acceptable only as arguments to
<code><nobr>DD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DQ</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>DT</nobr></code>. They are expressed in the traditional form:
digits, then a period, then optionally more digits, then optionally an
<code><nobr>E</nobr></code> followed by an exponent. The period is
mandatory, so that NASM can distinguish between
<code><nobr>dd 1</nobr></code>, which declares an integer constant, and
<code><nobr>dd 1.0</nobr></code> which declares a floating-point constant.
<p>Some examples:
<p><pre>
      dd    1.2                     ; an easy one 
      dq    1.e10                   ; 10,000,000,000 
      dq    1.e+10                  ; synonymous with 1.e10 
      dq    1.e-10                  ; 0.000 000 000 1 
      dt    3.141592653589793238462 ; pi
</pre>
<p>NASM cannot do compile-time arithmetic on floating-point constants. This
is because NASM is designed to be portable - although it always generates
code to run on x86 processors, the assembler itself can run on any system
with an ANSI C compiler. Therefore, the assembler cannot guarantee the
presence of a floating-point unit capable of handling the Intel number
formats, and so for NASM to be able to do floating arithmetic it would have
to include its own complete set of floating-point routines, which would
significantly increase the size of the assembler for very little benefit.
<h3><a name="section-3.5">3.5 Expressions</a></h3>
<p>Expressions in NASM are similar in syntax to those in C.
<p>NASM does not guarantee the size of the integers used to evaluate
expressions at compile time: since NASM can compile and run on 64-bit
systems quite happily, don't assume that expressions are evaluated in
32-bit registers and so try to make deliberate use of integer overflow. It
might not always work. The only thing NASM will guarantee is what's
guaranteed by ANSI C: you always have <em>at least</em> 32 bits to work in.
<p>NASM supports two special tokens in expressions, allowing calculations
to involve the current assembly position: the <code><nobr>$</nobr></code>
and <code><nobr>$$</nobr></code> tokens. <code><nobr>$</nobr></code>
evaluates to the assembly position at the beginning of the line containing
the expression; so you can code an infinite loop using
<code><nobr>JMP $</nobr></code>. <code><nobr>$$</nobr></code> evaluates to
the beginning of the current section; so you can tell how far into the
section you are by using <code><nobr>($-$$)</nobr></code>.
<p>The arithmetic operators provided by NASM are listed here, in increasing
order of precedence.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.1">3.5.1 <code><nobr>|</nobr></code>: Bitwise OR Operator</a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>|</nobr></code> operator gives a bitwise OR, exactly as
performed by the <code><nobr>OR</nobr></code> machine instruction. Bitwise
OR is the lowest-priority arithmetic operator supported by NASM.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.2">3.5.2 <code><nobr>^</nobr></code>: Bitwise XOR Operator</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>^</nobr></code> provides the bitwise XOR operation.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.3">3.5.3 <code><nobr>&amp;</nobr></code>: Bitwise AND Operator</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>&amp;</nobr></code> provides the bitwise AND operation.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.4">3.5.4 <code><nobr>&lt;&lt;</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>&gt;&gt;</nobr></code>: Bit Shift Operators</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>&lt;&lt;</nobr></code> gives a bit-shift to the left, just
as it does in C. So <code><nobr>5&lt;&lt;3</nobr></code> evaluates to 5
times 8, or 40. <code><nobr>&gt;&gt;</nobr></code> gives a bit-shift to the
right; in NASM, such a shift is <em>always</em> unsigned, so that the bits
shifted in from the left-hand end are filled with zero rather than a
sign-extension of the previous highest bit.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.5">3.5.5 <code><nobr>+</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>-</nobr></code>: Addition and Subtraction Operators</a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>+</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>-</nobr></code>
operators do perfectly ordinary addition and subtraction.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.6">3.5.6 <code><nobr>*</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>/</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>//</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>%</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>%%</nobr></code>: Multiplication and Division</a></h4>
<p><code><nobr>*</nobr></code> is the multiplication operator.
<code><nobr>/</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>//</nobr></code> are both
division operators: <code><nobr>/</nobr></code> is unsigned division and
<code><nobr>//</nobr></code> is signed division. Similarly,
<code><nobr>%</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>%%</nobr></code> provide
unsigned and signed modulo operators respectively.
<p>NASM, like ANSI C, provides no guarantees about the sensible operation
of the signed modulo operator.
<p>Since the <code><nobr>%</nobr></code> character is used extensively by
the macro preprocessor, you should ensure that both the signed and unsigned
modulo operators are followed by white space wherever they appear.
<h4><a name="section-3.5.7">3.5.7 Unary Operators: <code><nobr>+</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>-</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>~</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>SEG</nobr></code></a></h4>
<p>The highest-priority operators in NASM's expression grammar are those
which only apply to one argument. <code><nobr>-</nobr></code> negates its
operand, <code><nobr>+</nobr></code> does nothing (it's provided for
symmetry with <code><nobr>-</nobr></code>), <code><nobr>~</nobr></code>
computes the one's complement of its operand, and
<code><nobr>SEG</nobr></code> provides the segment address of its operand
(explained in more detail in <a href="#section-3.6">section 3.6</a>).
<h3><a name="section-3.6">3.6 <code><nobr>SEG</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>WRT</nobr></code></a></h3>
<p>When writing large 16-bit programs, which must be split into multiple
segments, it is often necessary to be able to refer to the segment part of
the address of a symbol. NASM supports the <code><nobr>SEG</nobr></code>
operator to perform this function.
<p>The <code><nobr>SEG</nobr></code> operator returns the
<em>preferred</em> segment base of a symbol, defined as the segment base
relative to which the offset of the symbol makes sense. So the code
<p><pre>
        mov     ax,seg symbol 
        mov     es,ax 
        mov     bx,symbol
</pre>
<p>will load <code><nobr>ES:BX</nobr></code> with a valid pointer to the
symbol <code><nobr>symbol</nobr></code>.
<p>Things can be more complex than this: since 16-bit segments and groups
may overlap, you might occasionally want to refer to some symbol using a
different segment base from the preferred one. NASM lets you do this, by
the use of the <code><nobr>WRT</nobr></code> (With Reference To) keyword.
So you can do things like
<p><pre>
        mov     ax,weird_seg        ; weird_seg is a segment base 
        mov     es,ax 
        mov     bx,symbol wrt weird_seg
</pre>
<p>to load <code><nobr>ES:BX</nobr></code> with a different, but
functionally equivalent, pointer to the symbol
<code><nobr>symbol</nobr></code>.
<p>NASM supports far (inter-segment) calls and jumps by means of the syntax
<code><nobr>call segment:offset</nobr></code>, where
<code><nobr>segment</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>offset</nobr></code> both
represent immediate values. So to call a far procedure, you could code
either of
<p><pre>
        call    (seg procedure):procedure 
        call    weird_seg:(procedure wrt weird_seg)
</pre>
<p>(The parentheses are included for clarity, to show the intended parsing
of the above instructions. They are not necessary in practice.)
<p>NASM supports the syntax <code><nobr>call far procedure</nobr></code> as
a synonym for the first of the above usages. <code><nobr>JMP</nobr></code>
works identically to <code><nobr>CALL</nobr></code> in these examples.
<p>To declare a far pointer to a data item in a data segment, you must code
<p><pre>
        dw      symbol, seg symbol
</pre>
<p>NASM supports no convenient synonym for this, though you can always
invent one using the macro processor.
<h3><a name="section-3.7">3.7 <code><nobr>STRICT</nobr></code>: Inhibiting Optimization</a></h3>
<p>When assembling with the optimizer set to level 2 or higher (see
<a href="nasmdoc2.html#section-2.1.16">section 2.1.16</a>), NASM will use
size specifiers (<code><nobr>BYTE</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>WORD</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>DWORD</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>QWORD</nobr></code>, or <code><nobr>TWORD</nobr></code>), but
will give them the smallest possible size. The keyword
<code><nobr>STRICT</nobr></code> can be used to inhibit optimization and
force a particular operand to be emitted in the specified size. For
example, with the optimizer on, and in <code><nobr>BITS 16</nobr></code>
mode,
<p><pre>
        push dword 33
</pre>
<p>is encoded in three bytes <code><nobr>66 6A 21</nobr></code>, whereas
<p><pre>
        push strict dword 33
</pre>
<p>is encoded in six bytes, with a full dword immediate operand
<code><nobr>66 68 21 00 00 00</nobr></code>.
<p>With the optimizer off, the same code (six bytes) is generated whether
the <code><nobr>STRICT</nobr></code> keyword was used or not.
<h3><a name="section-3.8">3.8 Critical Expressions</a></h3>
<p>A limitation of NASM is that it is a two-pass assembler; unlike TASM and
others, it will always do exactly two assembly passes. Therefore it is
unable to cope with source files that are complex enough to require three
or more passes.
<p>The first pass is used to determine the size of all the assembled code
and data, so that the second pass, when generating all the code, knows all
the symbol addresses the code refers to. So one thing NASM can't handle is
code whose size depends on the value of a symbol declared after the code in
question. For example,
<p><pre>
        times (label-$) db 0 
label:  db      'Where am I?'
</pre>
<p>The argument to <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> in this case could
equally legally evaluate to anything at all; NASM will reject this example
because it cannot tell the size of the <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> line
when it first sees it. It will just as firmly reject the slightly
paradoxical code
<p><pre>
        times (label-$+1) db 0 
label:  db      'NOW where am I?'
</pre>
<p>in which <em>any</em> value for the <code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code>
argument is by definition wrong!
<p>NASM rejects these examples by means of a concept called a <em>critical
expression</em>, which is defined to be an expression whose value is
required to be computable in the first pass, and which must therefore
depend only on symbols defined before it. The argument to the
<code><nobr>TIMES</nobr></code> prefix is a critical expression; for the
same reason, the arguments to the <code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code> family of
pseudo-instructions are also critical expressions.
<p>Critical expressions can crop up in other contexts as well: consider the
following code.
<p><pre>
                mov     ax,symbol1 
symbol1         equ     symbol2 
symbol2:
</pre>
<p>On the first pass, NASM cannot determine the value of
<code><nobr>symbol1</nobr></code>, because
<code><nobr>symbol1</nobr></code> is defined to be equal to
<code><nobr>symbol2</nobr></code> which NASM hasn't seen yet. On the second
pass, therefore, when it encounters the line
<code><nobr>mov ax,symbol1</nobr></code>, it is unable to generate the code
for it because it still doesn't know the value of
<code><nobr>symbol1</nobr></code>. On the next line, it would see the
<code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> again and be able to determine the value of
<code><nobr>symbol1</nobr></code>, but by then it would be too late.
<p>NASM avoids this problem by defining the right-hand side of an
<code><nobr>EQU</nobr></code> statement to be a critical expression, so the
definition of <code><nobr>symbol1</nobr></code> would be rejected in the
first pass.
<p>There is a related issue involving forward references: consider this
code fragment.
<p><pre>
        mov     eax,[ebx+offset] 
offset  equ     10
</pre>
<p>NASM, on pass one, must calculate the size of the instruction
<code><nobr>mov eax,[ebx+offset]</nobr></code> without knowing the value of
<code><nobr>offset</nobr></code>. It has no way of knowing that
<code><nobr>offset</nobr></code> is small enough to fit into a one-byte
offset field and that it could therefore get away with generating a shorter
form of the effective-address encoding; for all it knows, in pass one,
<code><nobr>offset</nobr></code> could be a symbol in the code segment, and
it might need the full four-byte form. So it is forced to compute the size
of the instruction to accommodate a four-byte address part. In pass two,
having made this decision, it is now forced to honour it and keep the
instruction large, so the code generated in this case is not as small as it
could have been. This problem can be solved by defining
<code><nobr>offset</nobr></code> before using it, or by forcing byte size
in the effective address by coding
<code><nobr>[byte ebx+offset]</nobr></code>.
<p>Note that use of the <code><nobr>-On</nobr></code> switch (with n&gt;=2)
makes some of the above no longer true (see
<a href="nasmdoc2.html#section-2.1.16">section 2.1.16</a>).
<h3><a name="section-3.9">3.9 Local Labels</a></h3>
<p>NASM gives special treatment to symbols beginning with a period. A label
beginning with a single period is treated as a <em>local</em> label, which
means that it is associated with the previous non-local label. So, for
example:
<p><pre>
label1  ; some code 

.loop 
        ; some more code 

        jne     .loop 
        ret 

label2  ; some code 

.loop 
        ; some more code 

        jne     .loop 
        ret
</pre>
<p>In the above code fragment, each <code><nobr>JNE</nobr></code>
instruction jumps to the line immediately before it, because the two
definitions of <code><nobr>.loop</nobr></code> are kept separate by virtue
of each being associated with the previous non-local label.
<p>This form of local label handling is borrowed from the old Amiga
assembler DevPac; however, NASM goes one step further, in allowing access
to local labels from other parts of the code. This is achieved by means of
<em>defining</em> a local label in terms of the previous non-local label:
the first definition of <code><nobr>.loop</nobr></code> above is really
defining a symbol called <code><nobr>label1.loop</nobr></code>, and the
second defines a symbol called <code><nobr>label2.loop</nobr></code>. So,
if you really needed to, you could write
<p><pre>
label3  ; some more code 
        ; and some more 

        jmp label1.loop
</pre>
<p>Sometimes it is useful - in a macro, for instance - to be able to define
a label which can be referenced from anywhere but which doesn't interfere
with the normal local-label mechanism. Such a label can't be non-local
because it would interfere with subsequent definitions of, and references
to, local labels; and it can't be local because the macro that defined it
wouldn't know the label's full name. NASM therefore introduces a third type
of label, which is probably only useful in macro definitions: if a label
begins with the special prefix <code><nobr>..@</nobr></code>, then it does
nothing to the local label mechanism. So you could code
<p><pre>
label1:                         ; a non-local label 
.local:                         ; this is really label1.local 
..@foo:                         ; this is a special symbol 
label2:                         ; another non-local label 
.local:                         ; this is really label2.local 

        jmp     ..@foo          ; this will jump three lines up
</pre>
<p>NASM has the capacity to define other special symbols beginning with a
double period: for example, <code><nobr>..start</nobr></code> is used to
specify the entry point in the <code><nobr>obj</nobr></code> output format
(see <a href="nasmdoc6.html#section-6.2.6">section 6.2.6</a>).
