<h2><a name="chapter-5">Chapter 5: Assembler Directives</a></h2>
<p>NASM, though it attempts to avoid the bureaucracy of assemblers like
MASM and TASM, is nevertheless forced to support a <em>few</em> directives.
These are described in this chapter.
<p>NASM's directives come in two types: <em>user-level</em> directives and
<em>primitive</em> directives. Typically, each directive has a user-level
form and a primitive form. In almost all cases, we recommend that users use
the user-level forms of the directives, which are implemented as macros
which call the primitive forms.
<p>Primitive directives are enclosed in square brackets; user-level
directives are not.
<p>In addition to the universal directives described in this chapter, each
object file format can optionally supply extra directives in order to
control particular features of that file format. These
<em>format-specific</em> directives are documented along with the formats
that implement them, in <a href="nasmdoc6.html">chapter 6</a>.
<h3><a name="section-5.1">5.1 <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code>: Specifying Target Processor Mode</a></h3>
<p>The <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code> directive specifies whether NASM
should generate code designed to run on a processor operating in 16-bit
mode, or code designed to run on a processor operating in 32-bit mode. The
syntax is <code><nobr>BITS 16</nobr></code> or
<code><nobr>BITS 32</nobr></code>.
<p>In most cases, you should not need to use <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code>
explicitly. The <code><nobr>aout</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>coff</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>elf</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>win32</nobr></code> object formats, which are designed for use
in 32-bit operating systems, all cause NASM to select 32-bit mode by
default. The <code><nobr>obj</nobr></code> object format allows you to
specify each segment you define as either <code><nobr>USE16</nobr></code>
or <code><nobr>USE32</nobr></code>, and NASM will set its operating mode
accordingly, so the use of the <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code> directive is
once again unnecessary.
<p>The most likely reason for using the <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code>
directive is to write 32-bit code in a flat binary file; this is because
the <code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> output format defaults to 16-bit mode in
anticipation of it being used most frequently to write DOS
<code><nobr>.COM</nobr></code> programs, DOS <code><nobr>.SYS</nobr></code>
device drivers and boot loader software.
<p>You do <em>not</em> need to specify <code><nobr>BITS 32</nobr></code>
merely in order to use 32-bit instructions in a 16-bit DOS program; if you
do, the assembler will generate incorrect code because it will be writing
code targeted at a 32-bit platform, to be run on a 16-bit one.
<p>When NASM is in <code><nobr>BITS 16</nobr></code> state, instructions
which use 32-bit data are prefixed with an 0x66 byte, and those referring
to 32-bit addresses have an 0x67 prefix. In
<code><nobr>BITS 32</nobr></code> state, the reverse is true: 32-bit
instructions require no prefixes, whereas instructions using 16-bit data
need an 0x66 and those working on 16-bit addresses need an 0x67.
<p>The <code><nobr>BITS</nobr></code> directive has an exactly equivalent
primitive form, <code><nobr>[BITS 16]</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>[BITS 32]</nobr></code>. The user-level form is a macro which
has no function other than to call the primitive form.
<p>Note that the space is neccessary, <code><nobr>BITS32</nobr></code> will
<em>not</em> work!
<h4><a name="section-5.1.1">5.1.1 <code><nobr>USE16</nobr></code> &amp; <code><nobr>USE32</nobr></code>: Aliases for BITS</a></h4>
<p>The `<code><nobr>USE16</nobr></code>' and
`<code><nobr>USE32</nobr></code>' directives can be used in place of
`<code><nobr>BITS 16</nobr></code>' and
`<code><nobr>BITS 32</nobr></code>', for compatibility with other
assemblers.
<h3><a name="section-5.2">5.2 <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code> or <code><nobr>SEGMENT</nobr></code>: Changing and Defining Sections</a></h3>
<p>The <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code> directive
(<code><nobr>SEGMENT</nobr></code> is an exactly equivalent synonym)
changes which section of the output file the code you write will be
assembled into. In some object file formats, the number and names of
sections are fixed; in others, the user may make up as many as they wish.
Hence <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code> may sometimes give an error
message, or may define a new section, if you try to switch to a section
that does not (yet) exist.
<p>The Unix object formats, and the <code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> object
format (but see <a href="nasmdoc6.html#section-6.1.3">section 6.1.3</a>,
all support the standardised section names <code><nobr>.text</nobr></code>,
<code><nobr>.data</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>.bss</nobr></code> for the
code, data and uninitialised-data sections. The
<code><nobr>obj</nobr></code> format, by contrast, does not recognise these
section names as being special, and indeed will strip off the leading
period of any section name that has one.
<h4><a name="section-5.2.1">5.2.1 The <code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code> Macro</a></h4>
<p>The <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code> directive is unusual in that its
user-level form functions differently from its primitive form. The
primitive form, <code><nobr>[SECTION xyz]</nobr></code>, simply switches
the current target section to the one given. The user-level form,
<code><nobr>SECTION xyz</nobr></code>, however, first defines the
single-line macro <code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code> to be the primitive
<code><nobr>[SECTION]</nobr></code> directive which it is about to issue,
and then issues it. So the user-level directive
<p><pre>
        SECTION .text
</pre>
<p>expands to the two lines
<p><pre>
%define __SECT__        [SECTION .text] 
        [SECTION .text]
</pre>
<p>Users may find it useful to make use of this in their own macros. For
example, the <code><nobr>writefile</nobr></code> macro defined in
<a href="nasmdoc4.html#section-4.3.3">section 4.3.3</a> can be usefully
rewritten in the following more sophisticated form:
<p><pre>
%macro  writefile 2+ 

        [section .data] 

  %%str:        db      %2 
  %%endstr: 

        __SECT__ 

        mov     dx,%%str 
        mov     cx,%%endstr-%%str 
        mov     bx,%1 
        mov     ah,0x40 
        int     0x21 

%endmacro
</pre>
<p>This form of the macro, once passed a string to output, first switches
temporarily to the data section of the file, using the primitive form of
the <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code> directive so as not to modify
<code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code>. It then declares its string in the data
section, and then invokes <code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code> to switch back
to <em>whichever</em> section the user was previously working in. It thus
avoids the need, in the previous version of the macro, to include a
<code><nobr>JMP</nobr></code> instruction to jump over the data, and also
does not fail if, in a complicated <code><nobr>OBJ</nobr></code> format
module, the user could potentially be assembling the code in any of several
separate code sections.
<h3><a name="section-5.3">5.3 <code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code>: Defining Absolute Labels</a></h3>
<p>The <code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code> directive can be thought of as an
alternative form of <code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code>: it causes the
subsequent code to be directed at no physical section, but at the
hypothetical section starting at the given absolute address. The only
instructions you can use in this mode are the
<code><nobr>RESB</nobr></code> family.
<p><code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code> is used as follows:
<p><pre>
absolute 0x1A 

    kbuf_chr    resw    1 
    kbuf_free   resw    1 
    kbuf        resw    16
</pre>
<p>This example describes a section of the PC BIOS data area, at segment
address 0x40: the above code defines <code><nobr>kbuf_chr</nobr></code> to
be 0x1A, <code><nobr>kbuf_free</nobr></code> to be 0x1C, and
<code><nobr>kbuf</nobr></code> to be 0x1E.
<p>The user-level form of <code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code>, like that of
<code><nobr>SECTION</nobr></code>, redefines the
<code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code> macro when it is invoked.
<p><code><nobr>STRUC</nobr></code> and <code><nobr>ENDSTRUC</nobr></code>
are defined as macros which use <code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code> (and
also <code><nobr>__SECT__</nobr></code>).
<p><code><nobr>ABSOLUTE</nobr></code> doesn't have to take an absolute
constant as an argument: it can take an expression (actually, a critical
expression: see <a href="nasmdoc3.html#section-3.8">section 3.8</a>) and it
can be a value in a segment. For example, a TSR can re-use its setup code
as run-time BSS like this:
<p><pre>
        org     100h               ; it's a .COM program 

        jmp     setup              ; setup code comes last 

        ; the resident part of the TSR goes here 
setup: 
        ; now write the code that installs the TSR here 

absolute setup 

runtimevar1     resw    1 
runtimevar2     resd    20 

tsr_end:
</pre>
<p>This defines some variables `on top of' the setup code, so that after
the setup has finished running, the space it took up can be re-used as data
storage for the running TSR. The symbol `tsr_end' can be used to calculate
the total size of the part of the TSR that needs to be made resident.
<h3><a name="section-5.4">5.4 <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>: Importing Symbols from Other Modules</a></h3>
<p><code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> is similar to the MASM directive
<code><nobr>EXTRN</nobr></code> and the C keyword
<code><nobr>extern</nobr></code>: it is used to declare a symbol which is
not defined anywhere in the module being assembled, but is assumed to be
defined in some other module and needs to be referred to by this one. Not
every object-file format can support external variables: the
<code><nobr>bin</nobr></code> format cannot.
<p>The <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> directive takes as many arguments
as you like. Each argument is the name of a symbol:
<p><pre>
extern  _printf 
extern  _sscanf,_fscanf
</pre>
<p>Some object-file formats provide extra features to the
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> directive. In all cases, the extra
features are used by suffixing a colon to the symbol name followed by
object-format specific text. For example, the <code><nobr>obj</nobr></code>
format allows you to declare that the default segment base of an external
should be the group <code><nobr>dgroup</nobr></code> by means of the
directive
<p><pre>
extern  _variable:wrt dgroup
</pre>
<p>The primitive form of <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> differs from the
user-level form only in that it can take only one argument at a time: the
support for multiple arguments is implemented at the preprocessor level.
<p>You can declare the same variable as <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>
more than once: NASM will quietly ignore the second and later
redeclarations. You can't declare a variable as
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> as well as something else, though.
<h3><a name="section-5.5">5.5 <code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code>: Exporting Symbols to Other Modules</a></h3>
<p><code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> is the other end of
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>: if one module declares a symbol as
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> and refers to it, then in order to prevent
linker errors, some other module must actually <em>define</em> the symbol
and declare it as <code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code>. Some assemblers use the
name <code><nobr>PUBLIC</nobr></code> for this purpose.
<p>The <code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> directive applying to a symbol must
appear <em>before</em> the definition of the symbol.
<p><code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> uses the same syntax as
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>, except that it must refer to symbols
which <em>are</em> defined in the same module as the
<code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> directive. For example:
<p><pre>
global _main 
_main: 
        ; some code
</pre>
<p><code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code>, like <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>,
allows object formats to define private extensions by means of a colon. The
<code><nobr>elf</nobr></code> object format, for example, lets you specify
whether global data items are functions or data:
<p><pre>
global  hashlookup:function, hashtable:data
</pre>
<p>Like <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>, the primitive form of
<code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> differs from the user-level form only in
that it can take only one argument at a time.
<h3><a name="section-5.6">5.6 <code><nobr>COMMON</nobr></code>: Defining Common Data Areas</a></h3>
<p>The <code><nobr>COMMON</nobr></code> directive is used to declare
<em>common variables</em>. A common variable is much like a global variable
declared in the uninitialised data section, so that
<p><pre>
common  intvar  4
</pre>
<p>is similar in function to
<p><pre>
global  intvar 
section .bss 

intvar  resd    1
</pre>
<p>The difference is that if more than one module defines the same common
variable, then at link time those variables will be <em>merged</em>, and
references to <code><nobr>intvar</nobr></code> in all modules will point at
the same piece of memory.
<p>Like <code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code>, <code><nobr>COMMON</nobr></code> supports
object-format specific extensions. For example, the
<code><nobr>obj</nobr></code> format allows common variables to be NEAR or
FAR, and the <code><nobr>elf</nobr></code> format allows you to specify the
alignment requirements of a common variable:
<p><pre>
common  commvar  4:near  ; works in OBJ 
common  intarray 100:4   ; works in ELF: 4 byte aligned
</pre>
<p>Once again, like <code><nobr>EXTERN</nobr></code> and
<code><nobr>GLOBAL</nobr></code>, the primitive form of
<code><nobr>COMMON</nobr></code> differs from the user-level form only in
that it can take only one argument at a time.
<h3><a name="section-5.7">5.7 <code><nobr>CPU</nobr></code>: Defining CPU Dependencies</a></h3>
<p>The <code><nobr>CPU</nobr></code> directive restricts assembly to those
instructions which are available on the specified CPU.
<p>Options are:
<ul>
<li><code><nobr>CPU 8086</nobr></code> Assemble only 8086 instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU 186</nobr></code> Assemble instructions up to the 80186
instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU 286</nobr></code> Assemble instructions up to the 286
instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU 386</nobr></code> Assemble instructions up to the 386
instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU 486</nobr></code> 486 instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU 586</nobr></code> Pentium instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU PENTIUM</nobr></code> Same as 586
<li><code><nobr>CPU 686</nobr></code> P6 instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU PPRO</nobr></code> Same as 686
<li><code><nobr>CPU P2</nobr></code> Same as 686
<li><code><nobr>CPU P3</nobr></code> Pentium III (Katmai) instruction sets
<li><code><nobr>CPU KATMAI</nobr></code> Same as P3
<li><code><nobr>CPU P4</nobr></code> Pentium 4 (Willamette) instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU WILLAMETTE</nobr></code> Same as P4
<li><code><nobr>CPU PRESCOTT</nobr></code> Prescott instruction set
<li><code><nobr>CPU IA64</nobr></code> IA64 CPU (in x86 mode) instruction
set
</ul>
<p>All options are case insensitive. All instructions will be selected only
if they apply to the selected CPU or lower. By default, all instructions
are available.
